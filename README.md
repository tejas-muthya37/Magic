# Magic ‚ú®


Magic is a Component Library for developers who do want to spend time styling their components.  
We let the user browse through our library and copy the code for whatever component meets their requirements.


The website will include a demonstration of the components with the code being displayed right below.
It's perfectly okay to just copy our code but we would appreciate it if you can try to understand what 
is going with the code before pasting it onto your website, so that it's easier for you to override our styles.



The components that Magic includes in it's v1.0 is as follows :- 

‚è© Alerts

‚è© Avatars

‚è© Badges

‚è© Buttons

‚è© Cards

‚è© Images

‚è© Inputs

Magic v1.1 - Coming soon, with more kickass components! üî•
